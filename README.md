# Button Box

The `release/` directory holds an easier to print version of the designs. The
designs in the main directory have the layers stacked, to help with alignment of
the layers during the design process.

## Bubu Box

Stickless fightstick/button box acrylic case design. Intended to be cut from 3mm
, 6mm acrylic and put together using acrylic glue/cement.

The design dimensions are for a 39mm tall box, but upon building, the interior
dimensions of the box were a bit low, resulting in the need to bend the Sanwa
button pins and the Raspberry Pi Pico connectors being too visible through the
top layer. Should experiment with more room in the interior of the box.
